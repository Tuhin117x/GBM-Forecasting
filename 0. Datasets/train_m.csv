You seriously need Biomed sensitive!!! The reason others still irritate and cause pain is because of the fluoride, chlorhexidine, triclosan and other strong antiseptics SLS/SLES they are aggressive. This toothpaste doesn't contain them and that's why you do not get sensivity! It's also why you don't get foam as some people have mentioned as though it's a bad thing. Foam is caused by the inclusion of SLS etc and ergo that SLS also causes pain. So you don't get foamy toothpaste - no - because 1: You don't need foam in beauty or health products. It serves no purpose it is purely there to give us the impression that something is working wonderfully! 2: Foaming products are purely there for the sensorial experience to make a product seem like it's doing more than it actually is. 3: That foamy toothpaste contain the aggressive SLS etc that can be aggravating to teeth but definitely aggravating and painful to already sensitive teeth. So why would you want it in a sensitive toothpaste. I did the research before buying months ago and would never use anything else because of this. Clean teeth is a pleasure again. Please ignore comments about it sadly not foaming! It takes seconds to research products.

This â€œPrime Defenseâ€ sanitizer still has the same active ingredient â€œethyl alcoholâ€œ but the concentration is higher with â€œethyl alcohol 85% v/vâ€ as compared to â€œethyl alcohol 70% v/vâ€. I assume thatâ€™s why this version is labeled â€œfor higher risk environments.â€ The label says this kills more than 99.99% of germs and has technology that â€œbreaks down cell wallsâ€ and â€œkills a broad spectrum of germsâ€ This has a more liquid like consistency rather than gel consistency Iâ€™m used to from Purell. While the gel is probably easier for kids to use as this can run off your hands, this one is good too and I just start rubbing my hands together more quickly so it doesnâ€™t run off. I like that this one actually dries faster, literally in seconds. This isnâ€™t fragranced and doesnâ€™t have a strong smell. Itâ€™s also not overly drying and has glycerin in it for moisture, but it could be drying if used often. I have confidence in this Purell hand sanitizer and highly recommend it. 5 stars.
