The Digi-Spark Prediction Challenge is a data science competition organized by the Unilever team which comprises of two tracks. Track 1 involves a forecasting business problem comprising of predicting sales volume for new product launches based on social media reviews. Track 2 uses the same data-set but requires participants to submit a well prepared storyboard using PowerBI. 

This repository houses the code used by our team for the Unilever Digi-Spark Prediction Challenge for Track 1. Our team has used the LightGBM library for preparing a forecasting pipeline which utilizes the social media reviews for generating different features which can be used for training a linear predictor model.
